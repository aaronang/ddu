* Thesis could possibly start with the fact that DDU in practice isn't working as we would expected.
* Case study on how DDU changes:
  * Real projects.
  * JPacman with extended tests, unit vs. integration.
  * Synthetic project, how to increase and decrease DDU.
* If DDU is too strict, how should DDU be adjusted?
  * DDU actually forces developers to create tests that do not make any sense. For example, if class A has two methods that are _not really_ related, it probably does not make any sense to cover these two methods in one test case.
* Publish survey? Where to publish?
* Push data to GitHub.
