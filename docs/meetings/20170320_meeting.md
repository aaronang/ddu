* Hypothesis of DDU paper: high DDU results in better diagnosability.
* :exclamation: Why do the components of DDU differ when using different granularities
* :exclamation: Could we use PITest and GZoltar together to confirm that packages with high DDU result in better fault diagnosis?
* Why do we need to cover multiple components in one test?
    * Some failures only appear when a certain combination of components is exercised.
* Private methods are tested indirectly
* Does DDU say something about how well private methods are tested?
    * It might just boil down to finding the caller.
* Parameterized tests have a bad effect on DDU.
* Mocks.
* Maybe it is interesting to come up with heuristics for the "ideal number of test cases"
    * Problem: how do you know when something is "good"?

Note:
* :exclamation: DDU meeting should be moved one hour later.
