# Meeting Notes
- Where exactly is the fault when dealing with multiple component faults?

## Next
- Extend tutorial: show usefulness of DDU in case of multiple component faults
- Analyze outliers in the scatterplots:
    - DDU vs. faulty spectra
    - DDU vs. average wasted effort
    - (Compare to coverage?)
- Think about chapters for thesis 
- For error detection plot use different values for cardinality and goodness
- Use different approach for computing wasted effort
    - Flatten diagnosis of Barinel and then compute wasted effort
    - Correct wasted effort (currently it is flawed?)
    - Normalize wasted effort with regard to number of components

## Thesis
- Thesis
    - Negative results?
    - Higher DDU results in better error detection
        - Is this good enough?
