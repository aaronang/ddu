# Agenda-ish

1. Analysis is difficult
2. Actionable suggestions aren't obvious


## Notes

 - Split test suite in different granularities: unit, system, integration, whatever.
 - Why are the observations different than the paper.
 - :warning: We could start at lower granularity first to come up with actionable suggestions.
 - EvoSuite DDU, entropy, branch coverage test generation.
 - PITest, it might not be feasible to generate failures that manifest only when multiple components are involved.


## TODO

- Write observations properly.
- Manipulate matrix and error vector with probability of failure. Then, measure effort for SFL techniques.
- Generate tests optimized for DDU and discard tests to see the impact on diagnosability.
- What tests would EvoSuite generate next?
    - There are some papers on understandability of EvoSuite generated tests
    - Do the tests make any sense?


## MISC

- Next meeting: 10.00 AM, April 10.
