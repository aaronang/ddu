- Show plots of independence between individual terms.
- GZoltar maybe for experiment?
- Separate project results.
- Analyze outliers.

# Next 
- Simple DDU tutorial how to affect the terms
    - Whether the test patterns in this playground example can be applied in practice
    - Smallest possible test suite?
- First percentage 

# Thesis
- Directions
    - Make sense out of DDU
    - Alternate DDU?
    - Individual terms
    - How to influence the numbers **in practice**
        - Just like code coverage
        - Better approach than trial and error
        - How realistic is the experiment of DDU?
            - Does it reflect practice?
