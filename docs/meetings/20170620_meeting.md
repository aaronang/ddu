## Agenda

- Stuck, don't really know how to write down everything structurally.
    - Feeling that it is not really scientific enough.

## Next

- Pick a class and write tests that optimize DDU or use different test approaches and see for each "version" how much the diagnosability improves.
    - Try to make sure that DDU is "causing" a better diagnosability and not error detection, if possible.

## Questions



## Misc

- Test generation vs. real world project.
- Increasing the DDU for a class might increase diagnosability.
    - Prior work used a fixed system, while in the case study we use different systems with varying DDU vallues.
- Validate fault model

## Plan

1. Pick a class that does not have too many dependencies, maybe with a low DDU.
2. Write tests with respect to optimizing DDU.
    - We could try to write tests to obtain a diagonal matrix.
    - Minimum tests to obtain optimal DDU.
    - If possible:
        - Optimized for density.
        - Optimized for diversity.
        - Optimized for uniqueness.
3. For each version, generate fault candidates and measure average wasted effort for Barinel

TODO:

1. Write tests for `org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue`
2. `mvn clean ddu:test`
3. `cp target/ddu-report/spectra/spectrum.csv ~/Code/ddu/code/analysis/data/spectra/branchjsoup.csv`
4. `./bin/metric_to_csv --input=jsoup --granularity=branch`
5. `effort_single_class.py`

>NOTE: Check if wasted effort is computed correctly!
