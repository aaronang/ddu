# Agenda

- Outliers from previous time:
  - Normalized wasted effort vs. DDU
- Error detection
- Why is error detection lower bounded by DDU

## Next

- Analyze correlation given failures are exclusively tested; check correlation density, diversity, uniqueness with error detection
- Regression line for DDU vs. average wasted effort
- Control for failed and passed executions, filtered and unfiltered

## Note

- Acknowledge exploratory study
- Diagnosability definition; given error detection then compute diagnosability?
    - Ability to pinpoint given matrices have failures
    - Ability to detect and pinpoint
